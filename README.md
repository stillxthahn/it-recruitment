## Description

This project **doesn't have any Back-End development**, so the dummy database is hosted through JSON-server and deployed in Vercel.

Due to this, any of POST, PACTH, DELETE OR GET methods won't work probably. Especially, POST or DELETE methods require a significant time to render correctly.

Link to the database: https://dummy-api-wine.vercel.app/
